### unsafe_encrypt

## I actually don't know how safe this thing is

# how it works:

run `node encrypt.js`
input the message

send the message to the receiver (after you have securely shared your two keys: messagekey.txt and signkey.txt)

the receiver runs `node decrypt.js` and gets the original message you entered
